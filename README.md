## Technologies Used
Apart from the common javascript libraries used, HTTP requests using axios are made to get the tracks and subsequently lyrics.
A web scraper(Pupeteer) is used to extract the lyric text form the Genius API, that returns the path to a specific song's lyrics.
A hashing algorithm is used to identify explicit content and then hash them. This algortithm is still being worked on. 
Finally, an output of "clean" lyrics is given.
{Tell me about the languages and tools you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}
